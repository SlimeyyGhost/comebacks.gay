            Hey! You might be wondering why I even made this site, but why does anyone do anything, right? anyways if you want to view the source code you can check it out <a href="https://github.com/SlimeyyGhost/comebacks.gay">Here</a>, Or if you would like to send in your own comebacks, you can send them <a href="https://forms.gle/aE87NYroDPVu6ot5A">here</a>

          <p>
            So you're a dick/pussy/asshole? (P.S. If they respond "No, I'm a man/woman!" just reply "You got a man/woman between your legs? kinda gay bro")
